# Computational Statistics Course Materials

Welcome to the repository of the Computational Statistics course, a part of the Applied Computer Science and Data Analysis program. This course is designed to equip students with advanced statistical analysis skills, utilizing the power of the R programming language.

## Course Objectives
- **Advanced Learning**: Master advanced statistical concepts and data analysis techniques.
- **Economic and Social Applications**: Apply statistical methods to real-world scenarios in economic and social domains.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Transition from basic to advanced statistical inference.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Engage with practical exercises using R to solidify understanding.

## Prerequisites
- A foundational knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics.

## Course Content

The course is divided into a series of Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific area of computational statistics. 
Jupyter notebooks have been created using R scripts provided in the dedicated folder.
Below is the complete list of notebooks included in this repository:
