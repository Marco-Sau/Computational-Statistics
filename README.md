# Computational Statistics Course Materials

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks, R scripts, and associated materials for the Computational Statistics course, part of the Applied Computer Science and Data Analysis curriculum. The course focuses on advanced statistical concepts and programming applications in the economic and social spheres, emphasizing high-dimensional and high-frequency data analysis.

## Course Objectives
- Grasp advanced statistical concepts and programming skills.
- Apply these skills to real-world economic and social data analysis.
- Transition from basic statistical concepts to more complex inferential statistics.
- Utilize the R programming language for statistical analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of descriptive and inferential statistics.

## Contents
This course covers a range of topics, from introductory to advanced levels, with a focus on multivariate data analysis. Key concepts of basic statistical inference are revisited and expanded upon. All topics are approached with practical applications and exercises using the open-source R software.

### Topics Include:
- Introduction to R Programming
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Data Visualization Techniques
- Probability and Random Variables
- Statistical Inference
- Linear Regression Models and Extensions
- Dimensionality Reduction Methods
- Cluster Analysis Algorithms

Each topic is encapsulated in its own Jupyter notebook for ease of access and study.

## Usage
To use these materials, clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) in an environment that supports the R language, such as RStudio or Jupyter Lab with an R kernel installed.
